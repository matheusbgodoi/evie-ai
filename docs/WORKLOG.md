## 2026-08-04 — Codex — Phase 0 repository bootstrap

- Commit: initial planning repository bootstrap
- Phase: Phase 0 — feasibility and architecture
- Completed:
  - researched TurboFieldfare, Hermes Agent, OmniVoice, Node-RED, QMD, CLUI CC, and
    native macOS overlay/lifecycle options;
  - calculated the current TurboFieldfare FP16 KV layout through 64K;
  - recorded the upstream failed/removed Q4 KV experiment;
  - defined architecture, lifecycle, UI, voice, RAG, automation, security, roadmap,
    evaluation, and handoff plans;
  - established defensive Git boundaries for secrets and personal data.
- Files/components:
  - documentation-only initial repository.
- Validation:
  - documentation links use upstream/official sources;
  - local repository and secret scans to be recorded before commit.
- Decisions/measurements:
  - 64K FP16 KV is approximately 1,505 MiB by source layout calculation;
  - Q4 KV is excluded from the baseline after upstream speed and quality failures;
  - native SwiftUI/AppKit shell preferred over reusing CLUI CC Electron runtime.
- Risks/blockers:
  - all runtime performance remains unmeasured on the exact base M5 machine;
  - no integrations or workers have been installed.
- Next action:
  - review and publish the planning repository privately, then build only the Phase
    1 benchmark harness after explicit implementation approval.
