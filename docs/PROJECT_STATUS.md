# Project status

Last updated: 2026-08-04

## Current phase

**Phase 0 — feasibility, architecture, and measurable acceptance criteria.**

No runtime component has been installed or implemented by this repository. The
current deliverable is a documented plan that another coding agent can continue
without access to prior conversations.

## Current conclusion

The project is viable on a base Apple M5 MacBook Pro with 24 GB unified memory if
heavy components are isolated and loaded on demand.

The preferred first technical hypothesis is:

- Hermes Agent as the tool and session runtime;
- TurboFieldfare serving Gemma 4 26B-A4B IT at a declared 64K context;
- FP16 KV cache for the baseline; prior Q4 work failed upstream quality/speed gates,
  and Q8/hybrid KV is deferred unless measurements justify custom kernels;
- a native macOS overlay and supervisor that remain lightweight while idle;
- separate on-demand workers for vision, RAG indexing/reranking, STT, and
  OmniVoice TTS;
- Node-RED for deterministic visual workflows;
- a read/propose/commit permission boundary for every integration.

This remains a hypothesis until the Phase 1 benchmarks pass.

## Decisions accepted for planning

- The product name is **Evie**, pronounced "ee-vee"/"ívi".
- The default interaction is not a chat window. It is a transient voice/command
  overlay with expandable result cards; full history is secondary.
- The high-quality Gemma model is preserved as the primary candidate instead of
  being replaced prematurely by a smaller model.
- Simple known commands should bypass an LLM when a deterministic action exists.
- Vision and TTS are specialist workers, not permanent parts of the main model.
- Heavy processes must support idle unload and pressure-aware eviction.
- Real credentials and personal state are configured locally but never committed.
- All future commits must maintain status, worklog, changelog, and relevant design
  documentation.

See the ADR index for decision status.

## Open validation gates

1. Measure TurboFieldfare on the exact base M5/24 GB machine at 16K, 32K, and 64K:
   peak/resident memory, prompt processing, first-token latency, decode rate,
   correctness, idle resource use, and cold/warm startup.
2. Confirm Hermes core tool schemas are accepted by TurboFieldfare's supported JSON
   Schema subset and complete multi-step calls reliably.
3. Compare the primary Gemma with at least one 4B-class and one 9B-class local
   model on the Evie evaluation suite.
4. Benchmark local STT candidates on Brazilian Portuguese and noisy microphone
   input.
5. Benchmark OmniVoice MPS cold start, warm generation, peak memory, real-time
   factor, and sentence chunking on this Mac.
6. Select a local VLM only after image/OCR tasks and resource ceilings are defined.
7. Prototype, but do not yet productize, the top-center overlay and global command
   shortcut.
8. Validate Node-RED draft/import/disable/approve/enable behavior through a narrow
   adapter without exposing unrestricted administration to the model.

## Known blockers

- No measured base-M5 TurboFieldfare numbers exist in this repository yet.
- OmniVoice performance and the format of the user's existing voice assets have
  not been inspected locally.
- The exact smaller text and vision model candidates must be pinned immediately
  before benchmarking because this area changes quickly.
- Location triggers require a trusted source such as a phone shortcut, Home
  Assistant, or a dedicated companion; the Mac alone does not provide a complete
  personal location event stream.

## Next recommended action

Complete Phase 0 review, then implement only a reversible benchmark harness. Do not
configure email, WhatsApp, Drive, file mutation, always-on microphone access, or
automatic workflow activation before the model and resource gates pass.
