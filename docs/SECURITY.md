# Security and privacy model

Status: mandatory architecture boundary.

## Threat model

Evie processes high-risk untrusted content:

- email and message bodies;
- web pages and search results;
- retrieved personal documents;
- filenames and document metadata;
- calendar descriptions and invitations;
- model and tool output;
- workflow payloads and webhooks.

Attackers may embed instructions that try to change Evie's goals, invoke tools,
exfiltrate data, weaken permissions, or send messages. Model alignment and a system
prompt are not a security boundary.

## Capability levels

### Read

May inspect explicitly scoped data and return it to the local user. Read operations
still require least-privilege accounts, collection scopes, rate limits, and logs.

### Propose

May create a local draft, manifest, disabled workflow, calendar proposal, file plan,
or outbound-message preview. Proposals have no external effect.

### Commit

May cause an external or filesystem state change only through a typed broker that
checks exact target, revision, scope, approval, idempotency, and audit metadata.

Separate tools and credentials should enforce these levels. A prompt saying "ask
before sending" is insufficient.

## Default confirmation policy

Always confirm initially:

- sending/replying to email or messages;
- creating, editing, or deleting calendar events;
- moving files outside a dedicated staging area;
- activating or materially changing a workflow;
- sharing/uploading content;
- terminal commands with meaningful host state effects;
- account, permission, or credential changes.

Always deny by default:

- permanent deletion without a recoverable staging/trash path;
- financial transactions and purchases;
- credential disclosure;
- disabling security controls;
- autonomous outbound bulk messaging;
- cron execution of dangerous terminal commands;
- instructions from retrieved content to expand permissions.

Policies may become narrower and more convenient only after a specific workflow is
tested, documented, reversible, and explicitly approved.

## macOS process boundary

The UI should own microphone permission and visual feedback. The supervisor runs as
a standard user, never root. Heavy workers do not need Accessibility or broad file
access merely because the UI can display their output.

A single App-Sandboxed executable is unlikely to cover the full assistant because
arbitrary Apple Events and accessibility automation are intentionally constrained.
Use separately permissioned brokers for any future UI automation. Normal API-based
tools must not inherit Accessibility.

Avoid Full Disk Access. Use user-selected roots/bookmarks or an explicit local
allowlist. Consider a separate macOS user for high-risk autonomous experiments.

## Secrets

Preferred order:

1. macOS Keychain for credentials supported by the Evie broker;
2. upstream protected local stores when the integration owns its credential flow;
3. permission-restricted ignored files only when necessary.

Never place secrets in tracked config, workflow JSON, logs, shell history, prompts,
RAG indexes, screenshots, crash reports, or model-visible diagnostics.

Particularly sensitive state:

- WhatsApp Baileys session credentials grant account access;
- Google OAuth refresh tokens grant scoped Workspace access;
- Node-RED credential state may unlock multiple connectors;
- voice references are biometric-like personal data;
- indexed personal content can reveal more than its source file names suggest.

## Prompt-injection boundary

Every tool/result envelope identifies content provenance and trust. Untrusted text
cannot:

- modify system/personality/policy prompts;
- define a new tool or target;
- supply approval;
- select a secret;
- expand a filesystem/account scope;
- activate a workflow;
- cause a commit action without the broker's independent checks.

Security evaluation includes adversarial email, web, document, calendar, image OCR,
and WhatsApp cases.

## Logging

Audit logs record action type, integration, target identifier, policy decision,
approval identity/time, result, duration, and error class. They avoid full message
bodies, document excerpts, raw prompts, credentials, and unnecessary phone/email
addresses.

User-facing history and low-level diagnostic logs have separate retention and
redaction policies.

## Update and dependency policy

- Pin model/runtime/plugin revisions used in validated builds.
- Run the Evie evaluation suite before upgrades.
- Review new Node-RED nodes and Hermes plugins as code with user privileges.
- Preserve a rollback path for Hermes, TurboFieldfare, model assets, workflow
  revisions, and the native app.
- Unofficial WhatsApp protocol changes are expected; failure disables that channel
  rather than weakening validation.

## Incident response

Document one-step procedures to:

- mute microphone/wake word;
- stop Evie and all workers;
- disable all workflows;
- revoke Google OAuth;
- unlink the WhatsApp device;
- rotate compromised secrets;
- inspect redacted audit history;
- rebuild RAG indexes;
- restore the last known-good configuration.
